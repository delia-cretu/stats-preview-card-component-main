## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I use two ways to display a bit of text, as a table for desktop and as paragraphs inside a div for mobile.
I also used the opacity attribute on an image for the first time.

### Continued development

I continue to learn about using CSS Flexbox to create quality mobile responsive designs.
